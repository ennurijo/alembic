Media Mapper is an open source, interactive geospatial visualization tool that allows media scholars to place their objects on a world map. Media Mapper provides the structure for Aqueous Earth Catalog, a database compiling films that feature bodies of water. Do you have a digital humanities project that uses geospatial data? You can use this mapper to place your objects on a world map, and your map will be featured under <b>Media Mapper in Action</b>. 

The Aqueous Earth Catalog and Media Mapper are both produced by Ennuri Jo, a media scholar and currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Advanced Research in Gloal Communication (CARGC) at the University of Pennsylvania. Both projects are funded by CARGC and created by Ben Tyler of Lost Creek Studios.
